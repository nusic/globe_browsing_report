\chapter{Conclusions}
From Figure \ref{fig:topdown} and \ref{fig:interaction} it is noted that the chunk tree grows as the camera comes closer to the surface, but the number of rendered chunks remain relativelty constant.

From Figure \ref{fig:interaction} we can see that the chunk tree grows as the camera views the horizon, as do the number of rendered chunks. When turning the the camera 180 degrees, the chunk tree shrinks temporarily. This is a result of the chunk tree being limited by available data. As the new texture tiles are downloaded, the chunk tree grows accordingly.
