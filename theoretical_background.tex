\chapter{Theoretical Background}

A sophisticated globe rendering system needs to rely on some mathematical foundations. These foundations together with different theories and algorithms developed for globe rendering works as a base for the research of this thesis.

\section{Modelling Globes}

We will discuss different proposed methods used for modelling and rendering of globes. The globe can be modelled either as a sphere or an ellipsoid and there are different tessellation schemes for meshing the globe. Different map projections can also be considered and it all ties together with a choice of level of detail algorithm.

\subsection{Globes as Ellipsoids}

Planets, moons and asteroids are generally more accurately modelled as ellipsoids than as spheres. Planets are often stretched out along their equatorial axes due to their rotation which causes the centripetal force to counter some of the gravitational force acting on the mass. This effect was proven in 1687 by Isac Newton in Principia Mathematica \cite{newton87}. The rotation causes a self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium to take the form of an oblate ellipsoid, otherwise known as a biaxial ellipsoid with one semimajor and one semiminor axis. Globes can be modeled as triaxial ellipsoids for more accuracy when it comes to smaller, more irregularly shaped objects. For example Phobos, one of Mars's two moons, is more accurately modeled as a triaxial ellipsoid with radii of $27 \times 22 \times 18$ km \cite{cozzi11}.

The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) standard defined by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) models the Earth as a biaxial ellipsoid with a semimajor axis of 6,378,137 m and a semiminor axis of 6,356,752.3142 m \cite{cozzi11}. This is what is known as a reference ellipsoid; a mathematical description that approximates the geoid of the earth as closely as possible. The WGS84 standard is widely used for GIS and plays an important role in accurate placements of objects such as satellites or spacecrafts with position coordinates relatively close to the Earth's surface. In the WGS84 coordinate system, the x-axis points to the prime meridian, the z-axis points to the north pole and the y-axis completes the right handed coordinate system, see figure \ref{fig:wgs84}.

\subsection{Tesselating the Ellipsoid}

Triangle models are still the most common way of modeling renderable objects in 3D graphics softwares, even though other rendering techniques such as volumetric ray casting also is possible for terrain rendering (src).

A triangle mesh, or more generally a polygon mesh, is defined by a limited number of surface elements. This means that ellipsoids need to be approximated by some sort of tessellation or subdivision surface when modeled as a polygon mesh. There are several techniques for tessellating an ellipsoid. Some of them are covered in this section.

\subsubsection{Geographic Grid Tessellation}

Tessellating the ellipsoid using a geographic grid is a very straightforward approach. Ellipsoid vertex positions can be calculated using a transform from geographic coordinates to cartesian model space coordinates \cite[p. 25]{cozzi11}. Figure \ref{fig:tesselation_geo} shows three geographic grid tessellations of ellipsoids with constant number of latitudinal segments of 4, 8 and 16 respectively.

A common issue with geographic grids is something referred to as polar pinching. At both of the poles, segments will be pinched to one point which leads to an increasing amount of segments per area. This in turn results in oversampling in textures as well as possible visual artefacts in shading due to the very thin quads at the poles as well as possible performance penalties for highly tessellated globes.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube Tessellation}
 
Another common tessellation method for spheres which can be generalized to ellipsoids is the quadrilateralized spherical cube tessellation. The standard approach is to subdivide a cube centered in the origin and then normalize the coordinates of all vertices to map them on a sphere. There are also other more complicated schemes designed to work with specific map projections \cite{dimi15}.

To model an ellipsoid from a sphere, the vertices can be linearly transformed with a scaling in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions individually. Figure \ref{fig:tesselation_cube} shows a tessellated spherical cube of four different detail levels.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Triangular Mesh}

The hierarchical triangular mesh (HTM) is a method of modeling the sky dome as a sphere proposed by astronomers in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \cite{htm}. Instead of uniformly dividing cube faces, an alternative option is to subdivide a normalized octahedron by, in each subdivision step, split every triangle into four new triangles, see figure \ref{fig:tesselation_htm}. An ellipsoid can be created from the sphere by normalizing the coordinates and linearly rescaling them the same way that can be done for the spherical cube tessellation.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Equal Area IsoLatitude Pixelation}

Hierarchical Equal Area IsoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) is spherical tessellation scheme with corresponding map projection. The base level of the tessellation is built up of twelve quads, similar to a rhombic dodecahedron, which each can be subdivided further. The tessellation in figure \ref{fig:tesselation_healpix} shows how the vertices in the HEALPix tessellation leads to curvilinear quads.

\subsubsection{Geographic Grid Tessellation With Polar Caps}

In their description of the ellipsoidal clipmaps method, Dimitrijevi\'{c} and Ran\v{c}i\'{c} introduces polar caps to avoid polar issues related to geographic grids \cite{dimi15}. The polar caps are simply used as a replacement of the problematic, oversampled regions around the poles. The caps can be modelled as grids projected onto the ellipsoid surface in their own georeferenced coordinate systems. One obvious issue with polar caps is the edge problem that occurs due to the fact that the caps are defined as separate meshes with vertices that do not coincide with the geographic vertices of the equatorial region, see figure caps. Dimitrijevi\'{c} and Ran\v{c}i\'{c} solves the issue by using a type of edge blending between the equatorial and polar segments \cite{dimi15}. Figure \ref{fig:tesselation_caps} shows a sphere tessellated with one equatorial region and two polar regions.
